  "body": "# Welcome Testers!\r\n\r\n### Info\r\nWhat you're (hopefully) about to play is a game with a computer-generated story. More accurately, you're going to play a really REALLY stripped down version, to find bugs I need to fix. I highly recommend you read this page before carrying on!\r\nExpect terrible pathfinding, crippling bugs and a general feeling of \"What the hell is going on?\" That's to be expected, I finished building this about an hour ago!\r\n\r\n### WARNINGS! \r\nThe game is really rough at the moment. It's very likely that it'll crash / lock up / just do something stupid! Luckily, the game takes about a minute to finish, so if it goes horribly wrong, you can always restart (alt+f4 is your friend).\r\nYou get a choice of resolution when the game runs, if possible choose 1920x1080 or 1280x720. Failing this, any resolution is fine but expect graphical bugs.\r\n\r\n### Game Instructions\r\nWhen the game starts, you can pick one of several characters to play as. Each of them is completely playable, but some are more fun than others! The game will explain loosely what you have to do from there on, but pressing shift in game will show you where all the other characters are, and what you are supposed to be doing at the moment.\r\n\r\n### Controls\r\nWASD - Movement\r\nControl - Attack\r\nAlt - Interact with people\r\nShift - Bring up help UI (points to people, tells you what your quest is)\r\n\r\n### Testing Instructions\r\n1. Download the program [here](http://somelink.com).\r\n2. Run the executable file in there, and have fun!\r\n3. If something goes really wrong, or you're finished playing, look in the folder named \"game_data\" for a file called \"output_log.txt\" Copy this somewhere else so that it doesn't get overwritten next time you play, and email any logs you've saved to me at cameronedwards145@gmail.com when you're done. Every log helps, even if nothing goes wrong!\r\n\r\n### Thanks and good luck!",
